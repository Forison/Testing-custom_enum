## Test Driven Custom Ruby Enumerable Methods Development

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").
The motive of this project is to replicate some enumerable methods in Ruby in a test driven environment.

>The selected method replicated in this project are:
- `each`

- `each_with_index`

- `select`

- `all?`

- `any?`

- `none?`

- `count`

- `map`

- `inject`

>replicated as:


- `my_each`

- `my_each_with_index`

- `my_select`

- `my_all?`

- `my_any?`

- `my_none?`

- `my_count`

- `my_map`

- `my_inject`

> selected methods for test driven exercise:


- `my_each`

- `my_select`

- `my_any?`

- `my_count`

- `my_map`

- `my_inject`

## Technologies

- Ruby

## Usage

> Clone the repository to your local machine

`sh
$ git clone https://github.com/forison/Testing-custom_enum.git`

> cd into the directory

`sh
$ cd custom_enum`

> open enum_methods with your favourite text editor or with irb.

## Deployment

>load the module and use our custom methods

`ruby
require "enum-methods"`
